# Six Towers Solver

Solve the [Six Towers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.papabuba64.Six_Towers&hl=en&gl=US) Game using this little Python Script

It reads the block setup from a `txt` file in the `input` folder and then uses
the minmax algorithm (more like a max algorithm, since there is no minimizing
player) to solve the puzzle

It still doesn't have the optimal solution. However, the minmax algorithm does a
pretty good job at getting close to it. Plans are that simple algorithm will
take the minmax's result and optimize it even further.
